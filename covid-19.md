### March 5th Update

On behalf on the committee members, we want to reach out to you regarding PhillyForce. We are monitoring the impact of COVID-19 (coronavirus) in our Ohana community, since our conference will be a large gathering in a public space. Our top priority is always the health and safety of our participants, speakers and committee. Currently, there have been no scheduling changes to our event and program. We expect staff who are feeling ill to stay home and request that participants who are ill not attend our event. We will be posting further updates on this website.
